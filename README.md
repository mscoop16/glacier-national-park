<h1 align="center">Glacier National Park Data Pipeline</h1>

## Overview
This repository contains a personal project that I built to enhance my Data Engineering skills. The end goal is to create a robust ETL pipeline from a variety of data sources that culminates in an insightful dashboard.

## Current Tasks
As of this moment, I am currently working on adding data quality checks to my pipeline and cleaning up my Airflow DAG architecture.

## Tools used
This project incorporates: Airflow (using Astronomer), AWS S3, Snowflake, and the dashboard is built with PowerBI. SQL, Pandas, and Polars are also all used.

## Future Goals
Currently, this project tracks information related to the travel and lodging for a trip to Glacier National Park. My next goal is to incorporate information from the National Park Service API about the park itself.
